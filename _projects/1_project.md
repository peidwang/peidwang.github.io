Man-made chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are the main reason for the Antarctic ozone “hole”. Under the Montreal Protocol, the production of these molecules has been regulated since 1990s. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were later used to replace CFCs. They are potent greenhouse gases, and their productions are also under regulation. It is important to understand all the loss pathways of these molecules to better estimate anthropogenic emissions and assess the global compliance to the Montreal Protocol.

The ocean uptake of these molecules was long been thought as a minor loss pathway. As anthropogenic emissions went down, natural losses become more important. We used a hierarchy of models to study the ocean uptake of CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs and assess the impact on emission estimations, as well as their implications on inferred atmospheric OH abundance.
