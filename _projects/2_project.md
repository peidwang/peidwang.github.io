Heterogeneous chlorine activation is a major driver for stratospheric ozone depletion and is understood to happen mainly on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) at temperatures below about 195 K. The 2020 Australian wildfire released large amounts of organic aerosols, whose chemical properties under stratospheric conditions are virtually unknown.

We combined the past 30 years of satellite data to estimate chlorine activation after a series of volcanic eruptions and wildfires of different magnitudes. We found that chlorine activation after major wildfires can happen at warm mid-latitude temperatures even above 220 K. Model incorporating such mechanism also shows remarkable agreement with the observations.
