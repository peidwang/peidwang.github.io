The theoretical foundation of pattern-based “fingerprinting” was introduced by Hasselmann (1983) and has since become a core technique in climate science for detecting and attributing human-induced climate signals amid natural variability. These fingerprints are typically applied to spatial patterns of climate variables. 

However, for chemical species like ozone—which are strongly influenced by solar radiation, temperature, and atmospheric transport—analyzing patterns across both month and altitude dimensions is especially useful for distinguishing different forcings. We applied this fingerprinting method in the month–height domain to investigate Antarctic ozone recovery, separating signals from greenhouse gas (GHG) and ozone-depleting substance (ODS) from internal variability noise. Our results show that the observed month–height trend pattern in Antarctic ozone is predominantly driven by declining ODS emissions and is unlikely to result from internal climate variability alone (with 95% confidence).
