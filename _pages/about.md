My name is Peidong Wang (王沛东), and I am a Stanford Science Fellow and postdoctoral researcher in Earth System Science at Stanford University, working with Dr. <a href="https://climatelab.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Noah Diffenbaugh</a>. My research interest lies at the intersection of stratospheric chemistry and climate variability. 

I earned my PhD in Climate Science at MIT, advised by Dr. <a href="https://www.ssolomongroup.mit.edu" target="_blank">Susan Solomon</a>. My doctoral work spanned three areas: (1) examining ocean influence on ozone-depleting substances emissions and atmospheric OH estimation; (2) investigating chemical and dynamical changes in the stratosphere following extreme wildfire events; and (3) quantifying the roles of external forcing and internal climate variability in observed stratospheric ozone trends.

I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I double majored in Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences and Applied Mathematics with a certificate in Computer Science. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research with Dr. <a href="https://hollowaygroup.org" target="_blank">Tracey Holloway</a> and participated in the Summer Student Fellowship at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution with Dr. <a href="https://ummenhofer.whoi.edu" target="_blank">Caroline Ummenhofer</a>.
