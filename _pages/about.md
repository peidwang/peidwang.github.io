My name is Peidong Wang (王沛东), I am a Stanford Science Fellow and postdoctoral researcher in Earth System Science at Stanford University, working with Dr. <a href="https://climatelab.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Noah Diffenbaugh</a>. I am interested in how stratospheric chemistry is coupled with variability in the atmosphere and ocean.

I earned my PhD in Climate Science at MIT, advised by Dr. <a href="https://www.ssolomongroup.mit.edu" target="_blank">Susan Solomon</a>. My doctoral work spanned three areas: (1) Natural sinks of ozone-depleting substances from the ocean and atmospheric OH, (2) Chemical and dynamical changes in the stratosphere following extreme wildfire events, and (3) The roles of external forcing and internal climate variability in interpreting observed stratospheric ozone trends.

I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I double-majored in Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences and Applied Mathematics, with a minor in Computer Science. As an undergraduate, I conducted research with Dr. <a href="https://hollowaygroup.org" target="_blank">Tracey Holloway</a> and was a Summer Student Fellow at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, working with Dr. <a href="https://ummenhofer.whoi.edu" target="_blank">Caroline Ummenhofer</a>.
