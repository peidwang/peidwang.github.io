My name is Peidong Wang (王沛东), I am a Stanford Science Fellow and postdoctoral researcher in Earth System Science at Stanford University, working with Dr. <a href="https://climatelab.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Noah Diffenbaugh</a>. My research focuses on the coupling between stratospheric chemistry and climate variability in the atmosphere and ocean.

I earned my PhD in Climate Science at MIT, advised by Dr. <a href="https://www.ssolomongroup.mit.edu" target="_blank">Susan Solomon</a>. My doctoral work spanned three areas: (1) The role of ocean and atmospheric OH sinks in constraining emission estimates of ozone-depleting substances, (2) Stratospheric chemical perturbations associated with extreme wildfire events, and (3) The influence of external forcing and internal variability on observed stratospheric ozone trends.

I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I double-majored in Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences and Applied Mathematics, with a minor in Computer Science. As an undergraduate, I conducted research with Dr. <a href="https://hollowaygroup.org" target="_blank">Tracey Holloway</a> and was a Summer Student Fellow at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, working with Dr. <a href="https://ummenhofer.whoi.edu" target="_blank">Caroline Ummenhofer</a>.
