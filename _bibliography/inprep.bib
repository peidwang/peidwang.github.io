	abstract = {Methyl chloroform (MCF) is a synthetic ozone-depleting substance used as an industrial solvent. Its primary sink is reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH), making it a key tracer for estimating atmospheric oxidative capacity. Following Montreal Protocol regulations, MCF emissions declined rapidly after the 1990s. However, the recent slowdown in atmospheric MCF decay suggests persistent emissions and/or declining OH (contradicting chemistry-climate models projecting increasing OH). The air-sea exchange of MCF has been poorly constrained due to limited observations and simplified ocean representations. We simulate oceanic MCF fluxes using a modern ocean reanalysis and validate with depth-resolved observations. Results suggest the ocean has shifted from a net sink to a net source around 2005, outgassing 0.5 Gg yr-1 in the 2010s (up to 30\% of inferred MCF emissions). This ocean outgas is an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates and can have important implications for interpreting OH levels from MCF records.},
