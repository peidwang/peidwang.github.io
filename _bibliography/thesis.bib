	abstract = {Stratospheric ozone serves as Earth’s natural protective layer, shielding the surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation. The discovery of the Antarctic ozone “hole” in the late 1980s raised significant societal and scientific concern, prompting the rapid regulation of ozonedepleting substances (ODSs) under international treaties. While the signs of ozone recovery have begun, new challenges continue to arise. This thesis investigates three critical factors driving stratospheric ozone changes and influencing the detection of ozone recovery: (1) ODS emissions, (2) chemical chlorine processes, and (3) internal climate variability. With ODS emissions being regulated under the Montreal Protocol and studies now focusing on illicit new production on the order of tens of gigagrams per year, the ocean’s role as both a natural source and sink of ODSs becomes increasingly important. However, these processes have often been overlooked or highly simplified in past ozone assessments. Using a hierarchy of models, from simple box models to global ocean general circulation models, I quantified the ocean’s uptake and release of various ODSs. Chapter 2 examines the ocean’s uptake of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), particularly emphasizing its influence on recent illicit CFC emissions estimation. Chapter 3 extends this analysis to include ocean uptake and potential microbial degradation processes, evaluating their effects on emission estimates for various hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are chemical constituents that have been used to replace CFCs. Once these man-made ODSs reach the stratosphere, they are photolyzed to chlorine reservoir species (e.g., HCl and ClONO2), which, through heterogeneous reactions, can transform into reactive chlorine that depletes ozone. While heterogeneous chlorine activation on volcanic ash is well understood, the unprecedented 2020 Australian wildfires raised new questions about chemical processes on smoke particles. This knowledge gap existed because only a few wildfires had injected significant amounts of smoke particles into the stratosphere during the satellite era. Leveraging over 30 years of satellite data, I separated chemical and dynamic processes affecting chlorine reservoir species to quantify chemical chlorine activation across different aerosol types. In Chapter 4, I developed a new approach to quantitatively estimate the onset temperature for chemical chlorine activation after the 2020 Australian wildfire using satellite observations. Chapter 5 applies this method to compare the impact of chemical chlorine activation from two independent wildfire events with that from a series of volcanic eruptions of varying magnitudes. Despite emerging challenges such as illicit emissions and recent wildfires and volcanic eruptions, advancements in observational records, our understanding of ozone chemistry, and computational power have significantly enhanced our ability to quantitatively detect and attribute stratospheric ozone changes. In Chapter 6, I applied a pattern-based “fingerprinting” technique to quantitatively separate the contributions of ODS forcing from other external forcings and internal variabilities in satellite observations. This analysis shows that Antarctic ozone increases cannot be explained by climate internal variability alone, providing strong confidence that ozone recovery is underway, primarily driven by human efforts to reduce ODS emissions.},
